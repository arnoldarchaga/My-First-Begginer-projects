# My First Beginner Projects

This repository contains my first beginner projects as I learn programming. Here's a brief overview of the projects and the concepts they cover:

## Project 1: Basic JavaScript Practice

This project is a simple JavaScript file named `practice.js` that covers basic programming concepts such as variables, string concatenation, conditional statements, loops, and basic calculations.

### Concepts Covered

- Variables: The code starts by declaring and initializing variables using the `var` keyword.
- String Concatenation: The `firstName` and `lastName` variables are concatenated to form a `fullName` which is then logged to the console.
- Conditional Statements: An `if-else` statement is used to check the age and log a message to the console based on the condition.
- Loops: A `for` loop is used to log a message to the console multiple times.
- Basic Calculations: The code calculates the birth year by subtracting the age from the current year.

## Project 2: [Basic Calculator]

# Simple Calculator

This project is a simple web-based calculator. The calculator can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Project Structure

The project consists of a single HTML file named `Calculator.html`. The file is structured as follows:

- **HTML**: The body of the HTML file contains the calculator interface, which includes two input fields for the numbers and four buttons for the arithmetic operations. The result of the operation is displayed in a paragraph element.

## Concepts Covered

- **HTML Structure**: The HTML structure of a web page is demonstrated, including the use of input fields, buttons, and paragraph elements.
- **CSS Styling**: Basic CSS styling is applied to the HTML elements to improve the appearance of the calculator (not shown in the excerpt).
- **JavaScript Event Listeners**: The use of JavaScript to add interactivity to a web page is demonstrated. Event listeners are added to the buttons to call a function when they are clicked.
- **JavaScript Functions**: The `calculate` function, which is called when a button is clicked, demonstrates how to define and call functions in JavaScript.

## Usage

To use the calculator, open the `Calculator.html` file in a web browser. Enter two numbers in the input fields, then click one of the operation buttons to perform that operation. The result will be displayed below the buttons.

## Future Enhancements

Future enhancements to this project could include adding more complex operations (such as exponentiation or trigonometric functions), improving the user interface, or adding error handling for invalid inputs.

## Installation and Usage

To run these projects, you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine. Once Node.js is installed, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone [repository_url]`.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run `node [filename.js]` to execute the JavaScript file in Node.js.

## Future Projects

I will be adding more projects to this repository as I continue to learn and practice programming. Stay tuned!
